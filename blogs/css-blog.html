        Web development is a constantly evolving field, with new frameworks and
        technologies emerging all the time. While these can be useful tools for
        building beautiful and functional websites, it's easy for web developers
        to become over-reliant on them and neglect the basics of CSS.
      </p>

      <h2 class="blog-header">Let's talk about how to resolve such issues</h2>

      <p class="blog-para">
        One of the most common mistakes I see among developers is jumping
        straight to a CSS framework without first gaining a solid understanding
        of plain CSS. This can lead to problems down the line, such as
        difficulty in customizing the framework to fit specific website designs,
        issues with integrating new features, and the inability to troubleshoot
        when issues arise.
      </p>

      <p class="blog-para">
        CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is the foundation of web design. It
        enables developers to control the layout, appearance, and behavior of a
        web page. Understanding CSS is essential to becoming a proficient web
        developer, as it allows for greater flexibility and control in the
        specification of design elements for a website.
      </p>

      <p class="blog-para">
        However, many developers make the mistake of skipping over CSS and
        jumping straight to using pre-packaged CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap
        or Foundation. While these frameworks can make web development quicker
        and more efficient, they should be used as tools and not as a
        replacement for plain CSS.
      </p>

      <p class="blog-para">
        One downside of relying too heavily on CSS frameworks is the difficulty
        in creating custom designs that fit specific website requirements. CSS
        frameworks provide a set of pre-defined classes and components that can
        be used to build a website quickly. However, they may not always
        perfectly align with a website's unique design requirements, leading to
        the need for custom modifications. Without a solid understanding of
        plain CSS, it can be difficult for developers to modify the framework to
        fit their website's design.
      </p>

      <p class="blog-para">
        Additionally, using CSS frameworks can lead to difficulty when
        integrating new features and functionality, as it may not always be
        clear how to implement them using the framework. This can cause
        frustration and delays in development time.
      </p>

      <p class="blog-para">
        Finally, relying too heavily on CSS frameworks can hinder a developer's
        ability to troubleshoot issues that may arise. When using a pre-packaged
        solution, it can be difficult for developers to identify and fix issues
        in the code, as they may not fully understand how the framework works
        behind the scenes. This can lead to a lack of control over the website's
        behavior and functionality.
      </p>
      <p>
        In conclusion, while CSS frameworks can be useful tools for web
        developers, it is important not to neglect the basics of plain CSS.
        Understanding CSS is essential for gaining greater flexibility and
        control in web design, allowing for the creation of custom designs that
        perfectly align with a website.
